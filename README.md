This is a simple calculator app.

I coding logic for the following:

- Basic calculations
- Making sure successive decimal points can't be added.
- Calculations an be chained rather than just a simple calculation using one operator (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division).
- If operator buttons are pressed in succession, only the last one pressed is used in the calculation.

It uses Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout.
