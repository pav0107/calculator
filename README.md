# Calculator

This is a simple calculator app.

I coded logic for the following:

- Basic calculations.
- Making sure successive decimal points can't be added.
- Chaining calculations, rather than just a simple calculation using one operator (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division).
- Making sure only the last operator button pressed is used in the calculation, if operator buttons are pressed in succession.

I used Flexbox and CSS Grid for the layout.
